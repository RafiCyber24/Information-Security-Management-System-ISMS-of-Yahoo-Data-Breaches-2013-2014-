### This report explores the major Yahoo data breaches of 2013–2014, investigating their root causes, attack methods, impacted assets, and the immediate consequences. Drawing from these incidents, it outlines an Information Security Management System (ISMS) suited for contemporary organizations facing comparable risks. The proposed ISMS defines its scope, catalogs key assets, establishes a detailed risk register, and implements a range of procedural, technical, and physical safeguards to address both past vulnerabilities and emerging threats.
